# Entry 1 — Preferential Plane Alignment of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS

This entry presents the first publication of *Volume 3* of the **Journal of Coherent Systems**, examining the geometric and statistical properties of interstellar object **3I/ATLAS**.  
The study quantifies the probability that 3I’s inbound trajectory—lying within roughly 2–3° of both the ecliptic and Jupiter’s Laplace plane—arose under random orientation.

---

## Overview
Monte Carlo and analytic isotropic simulations were used to evaluate the rarity of this *dual-plane coplanarity*.  
Results yield probabilities of **p ≈ 0.02–0.04**, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS’s approach geometry is statistically uncommon yet dynamically consistent with the Solar System’s coupled angular-momentum structure.

---

## Key Results
- 3I/ATLAS lies **2.34° from the ecliptic** and **2.63° from Jupiter’s Laplace plane**.  
- Dual alignment probability exceeds isotropic expectation by ≈ 20×.  
- Indicates partial angular coherence between Solar System reference planes.  
- Interpreted within a *coherence-weighted* framework, the object may trace a region of least dynamical resistance.
